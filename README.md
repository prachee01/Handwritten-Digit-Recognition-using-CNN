# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-CNN
This project involves recognizing handwritten digits (0 to 9) from the MNIST dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras and is capable of predicting digits from grayscale images. The project covers image preprocessing, CNN architecture design, training, and evaluation.
